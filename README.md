## Overview
The definite integral of a function can be computed numerically using the Trapezium or Simpson's Rule. The Trapezium rule evaluates the area under a graph *f(x)* as a set of trapezia with straight line segments while the Simpson's Rule uses segments with parabolic curves. The techniques are approximations of the definite integral and have lower- and upper-bound error values which can be found analytically. For the Trapezium Rule, the error can be found as: [1]

where *a* and *b* are the limits of the definite integral, *n* is the number of subintervals for the trapezia and Î¾ is an adjustable parameter which exists somewhere between *a* and *b*. For the Simpson's Rule, the error can be found as: [1]
